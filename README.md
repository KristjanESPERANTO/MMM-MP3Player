# MMM-MP3Player

## About
A [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/) module for playing music from folder at start up.
This is the version of the [MMM-MP3Player module](https://github.com/asimhsidd/MMM-MP3Player) remade to my needs.
A music player object is built inside the module, no iframe is used. The best position is bottom left, although it depends upon the user.
As soon as the module is loaded, the music starts playing!

```js
    modules: [
        {
			module: "MMM-MP3Player",
			position: "top_left", // not applicable for this module, position should be set in config section
			config: {
				position: "bottomLeft",

## Configuration

| Option		| Description |
| -----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `position`	| *Required* The position of the screencast window. <br>**Options:** `['bottomRight', 'bottomCenter', 'bottomLeft', 'center',  'topRight', 'topCenter', 'topLeft']` <br>**Type:** `string` <br>**Note:** This module config actual sets the location, not the magic mirror position config. |
| `musicPath`	| The path of the folder with .mp3 files. <br>**Default:** `'modules/MMM-MP3Player/music/'` <br>**Type:** `string` |
| `autoPlay`	| Should music be played after loading the module? <br>**Default:** `true` <br>**Type:** `boolean` |
| `random`	| Should music be shuffled? <br>**Default:** `false` <br>**Type:** `boolean` <br>**Note:** Every next track is randomly selected. So after the playlist ends the order of tracks will be another. |
* In case of `random: true`, previous track is not a track, played previously, it's a previous file in `musicPath` folder.

## Voice control

The playback can be controlled from another module (i.e. [voicecontrol](https://github.com/alexyak/voicecontrol)) with notifications.
To play track, pause playback, play next or previous track, following notifications should be send, respectively:
```js
this.sendNotification('PLAY_MUSIC', 'some_info');
this.sendNotification('STOP_MUSIC', 'some_info');
this.sendNotification('NEXT_TRACK', 'some_info');
this.sendNotification('PREVIOUS_TRACK', 'some_info');
```
